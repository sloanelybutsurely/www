i recently got rid of my smart phone (don't worry i'm not about to proselytize
here) and while i do actually have a goal of regularly feeling bored i have had
to find new things to fill my time other than endlessly scrolling.

so i found myself this holiday break reinstalling [NetNewsWire] and subscribing
to some RSS feeds (good old-fashioned, chronological RSS feeds.) it was there
that i came across john holdun's ["week in review #1"][john-week-in-review] and
jenn schiffer's [weekly retros][jenn-weekly-retros] which inspired it which has
in turn inspired me to do something similar as well.

## chorus

VOX (the columbus gay men's chorus's \[which includes everyone and not just gay
men\] small ensemble) held auditions on wednesday. i sang an a capella
rendition of kim petras's _[if jesus was a rockstar]_ which our director
brayton got a kick of of. thankfully it was also sufficient in securing me a
place in the group for another year.

## spiritual

on sunday i went to my first quaker [meeting for worship]. i have been
exploring quakerism for a month or so noew inspired by things my friend kevin
has shared (he sends his son to a quaker school) and catching glimpses of the
character [rachel murray] from the outlander series as hayley rewatched past
seasons in preparation for the upcoming one. i head read a couple of books
(_living the quaker way_ and _listening to the light_) and finally felt
comfortable attending a meeting. it was a really wonderful experience. i hadn't
really understood the concept of **testimony** (rising to speak during an
otherwise silent service) until i experienced it. i plan to make a habit of
attending.

## misc

in other news i've been working on building up this site
([sloanelybutsurely.com]) and adding simple email newsletter functionality,
getting back into my powerlifting routine (now with an in-person lifting
buddy!), and doing a lot of [reading] and journaling.

until next week!
