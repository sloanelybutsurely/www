I recently got rid of my smart phone (don't worry I'm not about to proselytize
here) and while i do actually have a goal of regularly feeling bored i have had
to find new things to fill my time other than endlessly scrolling.

So i found myself this holiday break reinstalling [NetNewsWire] and subscribing
to some RSS feeds (good old-fashioned, chronological RSS feeds.) it was there
that i came across John Holdun's ["week in review #1"][john-week-in-review] and
Jenn Schiffer's [weekly retros][jenn-weekly-retros] which inspired it which has
in turn inspired me to do something similar as well.

## Chorus

VOX (the Columbus gay men's chorus's \[which includes everyone and not just gay
men\] small ensemble) held auditions on Wednesday. I sang an a capella
rendition of Kim Petras's _[if jesus was a rockstar]_ which our director
Brayton got a kick of of. Thankfully it was also sufficient in securing me a
place in the group for another year.

## Spiritual

On Sunday i went to my first Quaker [meeting for worship]. I have been
exploring Quakerism for a month or so now inspired by things my friend Kevin
has shared (he sends his son to a Quaker school) and catching glimpses of the
character [rachel murray] from the outlander series as Hayley rewatched past
seasons in preparation for the upcoming one. I head read a couple of books
(_Living the Quaker Way_ and _Listening to the Light_) and finally felt
comfortable attending a meeting. It was a really wonderful experience. I hadn't
really understood the concept of **testimony** (rising to speak during an
otherwise silent service) until i experienced it. I plan to make a habit of
attending.

## Misc

In other news I've been working on building up this site
([sloanelybutsurely.com]) and adding simple email newsletter functionality,
getting back into my powerlifting routine (now with an in-person lifting
buddy!), and doing a lot of [reading] and journaling.

Until next week!
