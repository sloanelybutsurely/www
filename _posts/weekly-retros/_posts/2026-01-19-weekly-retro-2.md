## Christmas

Christmas is officially over in our home. All of the decor was put away to
clear room to host my sister's birthday party (a helpful catalyst).

## Books

I finished [_Things Become Other Things_][tbot], [Craig Mod]'s "walking memoir"
this week. I recommend it. I was expecting a straight forward travelog but
found an intimate memoir and reflection on class, childhood, loss, and the
cultural differences between the US and japan. I hope to walk through japan
myself some day.

I'm also reading _Embassytown_ by China Miéville (recommended by my friend
[Kevin]). I'm about a third of the way through and the plot is really starting
to pick up. I'm enjoying it so far.

## Music

I've been revisiting some mid-aughts electro-rock. I was searching for the
album We Are Pilots by Shiny Toy Guns in the library's catalog when i came
across [Nightmare Revisited]: a compilation of _Nightmare Before Christmas_
covers by alternative bands from the 2000s (Korn, Flyleaf, Evanescence's Amy
Lee, Rise Against, the All-American Rejects to name a few). Truly one of the
most Hot Topic mall goth things I've ever experienced. Delightful.

## All Ghillied Up

The weather has been a special kind of gray and cold with flurries that always
reminds me of a mission in _Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare_ called "[All
Ghillied Up]" where you sneak through Pripyat (the city made wasteland by the
Chernobyl meltdown) in a ghillie suit. Thinking about that game in my head
while i walk between my car and wherever I'm going is a little bit of pretend i
still indulge in.

## Name

A small programming update: I think weekly for these things is a bit too
frequent and strict a schedule. Going forward I'll post these as they come and
under the title "journal".
