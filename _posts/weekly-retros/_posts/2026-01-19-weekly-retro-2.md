## christmas

christmas is officially over in our home. all of the decor was put away to
clear room to host my sister's birthday party (a helpful catalyst).

## books

i finished [_things become other things_][tbot], [craig mod]'s "walking memoir"
this week. i recommend it. i was expecting a straight forward travelog but
found an intimate memoir and reflection on class, childhood, loss, and the
cultural differences between the US and japan. i hope to walk through japan
myself some day.

i'm also reading _embassytown_ by china miéville (recommended by my friend
[kevin]). i'm about a third of the way through and the plot is really starting
to pick up. i'm enjoying it so far.

## music

i've been revisiting some mid-aughts electro-rock. i was searching for the
album we are pilots by shiny toy guns in the library's catalog when i came
across [nightmare revisited]: a compilation of _nightmare before christmas_
covers by alternative bands from the 2000s (korn, flyleaf, evanescence's amy
lee, rise against, the all-american rejects to name a few). truly one of the
most hot topic mall goth things i've ever experienced. delightful.

## all ghillied up

the weather has been a special kind of gray and cold with flurries that always
reminds me of a mission in _call of duty 4: modern warfare_ called "[all
ghillied up]" where you sneak through pripyat (the city made wasteland by the
chernobyl meltdown) in a ghillie suit. thinking about that game in my head
while i walk between my car and wherever i'm going is a little bit of pretend i
still indulge in.

## name

a small programming update: i think weekly for these things is a bit too
frequent and strict a schedule. going forward i'll post these as they come and
under the title "journal".
