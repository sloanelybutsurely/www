title: 'this here article: "In 2026, We Are Friction-Maxxing"'
---

earlier this month i read Kathryn Jezer-Morton's ["In 2026, We Are
Friction-Maxxing"][friction-maxxing][^archive] and i've come back to it a few
times.

i was on this "friction-maxxing" track already but it is nice to have something
to call it and the confirmation that there are other folks feeling the same way
i do.
