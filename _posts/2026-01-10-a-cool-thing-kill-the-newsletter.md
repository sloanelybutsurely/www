I was looking for a service that would take the RSS feed from this site and
turn it into an email newsletter (I'm still looking by the way!) when I came
across [Kill The Newsletter!][kill-the-newsletter] which is kind of the inverse
of what I was going for but still neat.

Kill The Newsletter! lets you create feeds associated with an email address so
you can subscribe to newsletters in your feed reader of choice (I like
[NewNewsWire][netnewswire]).

Over the past year or so we have been approaching peak email newsletter so
maybe give this a try and bring some peace to your Inbox.
