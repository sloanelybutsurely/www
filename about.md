I'm Sloane. I'm a trans woman in her thirties living in Ohio. I have a home
with my wonderful wife Hayley. We have a cat named stickers and a dog named
Theo. At my day job i write software (mostly in Elixir). I also have a small
software startup ([screen.garden](https://screen.garden)) with my friend Kevin.
In my free time I like to take photos, cook, read, watch movies, listen to
music, and sing. I've also DMed some table-top RPG games but as is so often the
case scheduling difficulties got the best of them.
